### Parameters

```python
@dataclass
class SteadyStateParams:
    window_size: int = 0 # Window size used for CAS analysis and for index comparison
    cas_threshold: float = 0.0 # compilation_time_ns activity
    smoothen_window_size: int = 0 # Window size used for smoothening
    kernel_size: int = 0 # Kernel size used in KB-KSSD
    comparison_window_size: int = 0 # Window size used for comparison
```

- Parameters:

```python
n = len(dt)
self.params.window_size = int(np.clip(n * 0.10, 5, 50))
peak_activity = np.max(compilation_activity)
self.params.cas_threshold = float(peak_activity * 0.009)
self.params.smoothen_window_size = int(np.clip(n * 0.10, 5, 200))
self.params.kernel_size = int(np.clip(n * 0.15, 2, 16))
self.params.comparison_window_size = int(np.clip(n * 0.10, 5, 100))
```

- The above parameters were picked purerly based on expert judgement and trial and error. The idea is the CAS analysis will be more strict to pick the earliest possible drop and for the POS analysis to be less flexible and work with different proportionalities. Hence the large smoothening window and the small kernel size.
