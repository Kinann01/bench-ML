Major:

- What do we do if they are very spikey. i.e. data in general is very spiky and noise.
- Add full support for POS analysis in cases where compilation activity is missing

Minor:

- Not necessarily a TODO but keep an eye on how needs_analysis() is done. The thresholds might need to be re-adjusted later when more data is visited.
- _calculate_metric() needs error handling
- _smoothen() is defined twice in two different places.
